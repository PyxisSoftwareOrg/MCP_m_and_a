# M&A Research Assistant Documentation

## Document Structure

This project is organized into three key documents:

### 1. `prd/main_spec.md` - Product Requirements Document
Contains business requirements only:
- Business objectives and target users
- Core features and functionality
- User workflows and business rules
- Success metrics and future enhancements
- NO technical implementation details

### 2. `prd/technical_design.md` - Technical Specifications
Contains all technical details:
- System architecture and technology stack
- MCP tools implementation details
- Data models and schemas
- API integrations and configurations
- Performance, security, and deployment specifications

### 3. `prd/implementation_tasks.md` - Implementation Tasks
Contains development tasks organized by phase:
- Project setup and infrastructure
- Core feature implementation
- Testing and deployment tasks
- Dependencies and success criteria
- Risk mitigation strategies

### 4. `prd/validation_criteria.md` - Validation Criteria
Contains QA and testing specifications:
- 10+ automated QA test specifications
- Manual testing procedures
- Acceptance criteria and performance requirements
- Security and compliance validation
- Continuous integration test pipeline

## Quick Start

1. **For Business Stakeholders**: Read `prd/main_spec.md` to understand what the system does
2. **For Technical Team**: Review `prd/technical_design.md` for implementation details
3. **For Developers**: Use `prd/implementation_tasks.md` as your implementation checklist
4. **For QA Team**: Use `prd/validation_criteria.md` for testing specifications and acceptance criteria

## Original Documentation

The original combined PRD (containing both business and technical details) has been archived as `prd_original.md` for historical reference.

## Feature Development

When adding new features to the M&A Research Assistant:

1. **Create a feature folder**: Place new feature PRDs in `prd/features/{feature-name}/`
2. **Include documentation**: Each feature folder should contain:
   - Feature specification document
   - Technical design (if applicable)
   - Integration requirements
   - Testing criteria
3. **Update main PRDs**: Reference the new feature in the appropriate main PRD documents

## Project Status

This documentation represents the complete requirements and technical design for the M&A Research Assistant MCP Server. Implementation should follow the phased approach outlined in `prd/implementation_tasks.md`.
